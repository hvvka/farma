Console game made while learning objective programming paradigm as a 1st year student.

It has a lots of flaws which I decided to fix after Msc graduation and ~3 years of professional experience in Java. And
it's in Polish!

**The game is a farm simulator. One can breed pigs, buy and then upgrade a guard dog to protect the business.**

## Sample gameplay
